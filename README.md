# GDP_and_energy_used_Visualization
Now imagine this scenario Am working as a data analyst for a policy research institute for your current project. You need to create a visualization that shows the CO2 emissions per capita for each country from 2000-2011. You'll also provide information about each country's population GDP and energy use. All right, let's get started.

I already have a dataset that includes emissions for each country between the years 1960 - 2011. But, the information that you need on energy use, total population, and GDP you had to collect from a government website. Each dataset is in a separate file. Moreover, some of the information is missing for some countries. 

Often you will work with datasets that are missing information. Whether or not you need to find this missing information will depend on your project. In this case, I notice that the missing information is from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. 

Luckily, your project is only concerned with the data from 2000-2011. You need an efficient way to utilize some data from one source, and some data from other sources.

- Taking just the information that you need from each source and creating a new data source takes a lot of time.Tableau allows you to link data from different sources, as well as import data from different formats, While I will be working with one in this Project, 

- Tableau allows you to use a Web Data Connector. This tool allows you to import the data you need directly from another site. Your visualizations will update when the data sources for your visualization are updated.
